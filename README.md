## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Protocol Buffers compiler (`protoc`)
- Required Go packages for protobuf generation

### Setup

1. **Install required tools:**
   ```bash
   # Install protoc (macOS)
   brew install protobuf
   
   # Install Go protobuf generators
   go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
   go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
   ```

2. **Clone and build:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rossheaney/discompute
   cd discompute
   make setup
   make build
   ```

### Usage

#### Mac/Linux/Windows Usage

Start the discompute service on your desktop/server:

```bash
# Start with default settings
./bin/discompute start

# Start with custom port and debug logging  
./bin/discompute start --port 9090 --debug

# Show device capabilities
./bin/discompute info
```

#### iPhone/iPad Usage  

Deploy and run on iOS devices:

```bash
# Build for iOS
./scripts/build-ios.sh

# Copy bin/discompute-ios to your iPhone/iPad
# Via Xcode, ios-deploy, or file transfer

# On iPhone/iPad, run:
./discompute-ios start --port 8080 --debug
```

**iOS Deployment Options:**
- **Jailbroken devices**: Direct binary execution
- **Enterprise certificate**: Deploy via enterprise MDM
- **TestFlight**: Package as iOS app for testing
- **Development**: Use Xcode for development builds

#### List Discovered Devices

See what devices are available on your network:

```bash
./bin/discompute list
```

Example output:
```

### Communication Protocol

The system uses gRPC for device-to-device communication with the following services:

- **RegisterDevice**: Register a device in the network
- **SendMessage**: Send messages between devices  
- **Heartbeat**: Maintain device status and health
- **GetDevices**: Retrieve list of available devices
- **SubmitTask**: Submit compute tasks for distribution
- **ExecuteSubtask**: Execute distributed subtasks
- **GetTaskStatus**: Monitor task progress

### Device Discovery (UDP-based)

Uses UDP broadcasts for automatic device discovery (inspired by EXO):
- Each device broadcasts presence every 2.5 seconds using UDP
- Discovers devices across WiFi, Ethernet, and cellular networks
- Automatic device capability detection and TFLOPS calculation
- Peer-to-peer architecture with no central coordinator required
- Works reliably across iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, and Android

## Configuration

Configuration can be provided via:
- Command-line flags
- Environment variables
- YAML configuration file (`~/.discompute.yaml`)

Example configuration file:
```yaml
debug: true
port: 8080
tls: false
device-id: "my-custom-device-id"
```

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Generate protobuf files
make proto

# Build the CLI
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

### Cross-Platform Builds

```bash
# Build for macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
make build-darwin

# Build for iOS (requires iOS Go toolchain)
make build-ios
```

### Development Mode

Run the service in development mode with debug logging:

```bash
make dev-run
```
