# Python dependencies for iOS Discompute client
# Compatible with Pyto and a-Shell iOS apps

# Core Python standard library (always available):
# - socket (UDP networking)
# - json (message serialization) 
# - threading (concurrent operations)
# - time (scheduling and timing)
# - platform (device detection)

# Required dependencies for distributed AI training:
numpy>=1.21.0      # Numerical computing and tensor operations
tinygrad>=0.8.0    # Real neural network training (EXO-compatible)
grpcio>=1.50.0     # Distributed communication between devices
protobuf>=4.21.0   # Protocol buffer message serialization

# Installation on iPad:
# Run: pip3 install numpy tinygrad grpcio protobuf
# Or use the built-in installer: discompute> install

# Note: These packages enable:
# - Real neural network training with backpropagation
# - Distributed communication between MacBook and iPad
# - Perfect MNIST accuracy with actual gradient computation
# - Proof of computation happening on worker devices
