# Python dependencies for iOS Discompute client
# Compatible with Pyto and a-Shell iOS apps

# No external dependencies required!
# The client uses only Python standard library:
# - socket (UDP networking)
# - json (message serialization) 
# - threading (concurrent operations)
# - time (scheduling and timing)
# - platform (device detection)

# Optional dependencies for enhanced functionality:
# requests>=2.28.0  # For HTTP-based discovery fallback
# grpcio>=1.50.0    # For full gRPC client support (large dependency)
# protobuf>=4.21.0  # For protocol buffer support

# Note: Keep dependencies minimal for iOS compatibility
# Pyto and a-Shell have limited package installation capabilities
